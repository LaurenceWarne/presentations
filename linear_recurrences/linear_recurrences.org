* Introduction

We can define a linear recurrence as sequence \( a_n \) satisfying \( a_n = C_{n - 1}a_{n - 1} + ... + C_{n - k}a_{n - k} \) along with a set of base cases \( a_1 = D_1 ... a_k = D_k \).

Perhaps the most famous example is the Fibonacci Sequence:

\[
F_1 = F_2 = 1, F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}
\]

* Of the First Order

\( a_n = ra_{n - 1}, \ a_1 = a \)
